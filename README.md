# connectNodesHTML

This web application calculates the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm for a set of nodes, helping you find the most cost-efficient way to connect them.

Features
1) Input a set of nodes with associated costs or randomized points
2) Calculate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm.
3) Visual representation of the MST.
4) Display the minimum cost to connect all nodes.
